# Design Thoughts

- I want it to be able to use a prompt writer prompt to create role documents on the fly
- Do we support partial subcommand names eg: `start con ag` for start config agent?
- Do all the subcommands support --help?

## Roles

- `start role` with relevant subcommands
- `start role generate <description of role>` - I want it to be able to use a prompt writer prompt to create role documents on the fly
