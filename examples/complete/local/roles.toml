# MERGE BEHAVIOR
# ============================================================================
# Global + local roles are combined
# Same name in local COMPLETELY replaces global (no field merging)
# Different names are additive
#
# Example:
#   Global has: file-only, inline, file-with-template
#   Local has: code-reviewer (override), project-expert (new)
#   Result: file-only, inline, file-with-template, code-reviewer (local), project-expert
